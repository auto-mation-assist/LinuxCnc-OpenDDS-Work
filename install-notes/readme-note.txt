# LinuxCnc-OpenDDS-Work

This folder will contain notes related to how to install openDDS and the depends for the inuxCnc for the openDDS project

Addition 1:

The second install was completed which has less configure options enabled. It also added two item in the depends.
These were added since they were listed in some tests but never got a "1" marking to say they are available to use.
Prehaps a reboot was required.
